  description: For anyone reading this, this is my second day at this small island.
    I've been living of fish since there doesn't seem to grow anything else here,
    and these cabbage like plants don't seem very tasty either. But there's an upside,
    this statue on the island seems very friendly and wants to help me. He said he's
    stuck here for quite some time now. I also found this strange stone with some
    sort of hieroglyphs on it, but I don't think it's anything special. Hopefully
    I will make it out here soon.
