Good morning and thank you for using ACE

If you opened this file you probably want to give an enemy you made a new move.
Here's how you can do that:

- Make sure you have an enemy object ready to use
(There's a template in the Enemies folder)

If you haven't made one, check "How to add an enemy".

- When in the enemy object, click the "+" button on the bottom right side of Moveset

- After pressing this button a new menu will pop up,
Here an explanation for each field:

 Move Name: Name of the move 
 (this is connected to the animator if you want to give the move an animation)
 Move Type: Type of move, more about each option:
  Melee - Melee attack
  Block - The enemy will block a percentage of damage from attacks of the player for a certain time.
  Dash - A dash that goes through the player dealing damage
  Dodge - A dodge when the player gets to close
  Healing - WIP
  Buffing - WIP
  Ranged - A ranged attack shooting a projectile

 Damage - Damage the attack will do (does nothing for dodges and blocks etc.)
 Cooldown - Cooldown until the move can be used again
 Probability - Does nothing atm (used to calculate probability after player's behaviour)
 Base Probability - Base probability of each move (Doesn't have to come up to 100 total)
 Move Range - Min range when the move can be used
 Charge Time - Short duration wherein the enemy will be charging 
 (Only for melee and ranged attacks)
 Move Anim - Coresponding animation (Used for the duration of the animation)
 Attack Effect - WIP

 BLOCK:
  Block percentage - percentage of damage that will be blocked after an attack of the player 
  (range 0-100)
  Block time - Max time the enemy is allowed to block

 DASH:
  Dash speed - Speed of the dash (I recommend using 10, higher for a faster movement)
  Dash duration - Duration of the dash (I recommend using 0.2, higher for a longer dash)

 DODGE:
  Dodge speed - Same as dash speed
  Dash duration - Same as dash duration

 RANGED:
  Projectile - Prefab of the projectile (Scroll down to see how to make a new projectile)
  Projectile speed - Speed that the projectile will travel at

That'll be it for creating a moveset for an enemy. Good Luck (:


More:

 - Creating a new projectile
  Create a new instance 2D OBJECTS > SPRITES > [Your prefered sprite]

  Add a sprite to the projectile

  Add a projectile controller script (You don't have to do anything with this script)

  Add a rigidbody and disable gravity, GRAVITY SCALE = 0

  Add a circle collider with your prefered radius

  After everything is added, you can drag the instance to a prefered folder 
  where you want to store your prefab.
  Now you can drag the prefab into the Projectile field of the enemy's move
