Good morning and thank you for using ACE

If you opened this file you probably want to create animations for your enemies.

- First step to animating your enemies is to create the animation clips

 If you haven't done this already, start by creating a new folder for animations
 Preferably a folder per enemy in your game.

 Start by opening the Animation window, WINDOW > ANIMATION > ANIMATION.
 After that, select the enemy you want to animate and select Create.
 Give the animation a good name, this will also immediately create a controller.
 Now that you've made an animation clip you can start creating the animation.

- Second step is to implement the clips into the controller.
 
 When you've created the clips a controller should've been added to the folder as well.

 All the clips you've made also should appear in the controller.
 Start by connecting the main sprite [in most cases the front sprite] to "Entry"
 You can do this by right clicking "Entry" and click on "Make transition"
 Now it's time to connect the other animations.

 When you have multiple animations of the same move,
 for example, you have a front, back, left and right animation for an attack.
 You can use a Blend Tree, right click > CREATE STATE > FROM NEW BLEND TREE

 When everything is connected add conditions by selecting a connection.
 To add conditions, start by adding parameters.
 On the top left of the Animator select Parameters,
 and start adding the parameters:
 Direction - float
 Speed - float
 And parameters for your moves - bool
 The parameters for the moves should have the same name as the move.
 Using the "Exit" and "Any state" is not necesary.

- Final step is to add the controller to the enemy.

 Do this by selecting the enemy, ANIMATOR > CONTROLLER > select the controller you made

Also make sure the Animation clip is selected in the coresponding move in the enemy object.

Everything should be ready to use by now,
good luck (:
