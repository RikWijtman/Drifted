Good morning and thank you for using ACE

If you opened this file you're probably curious how you can make your own enemy.
I'll explain how to in a few steps.

- First we want to make an enemy object

 In this object all the data of the enemy is stored.
 to make an enemy object you right click in the folder you want to add the object. 
 When in the menu select CREATE > COMBAT > ENEMY

 When you're ready you can give the object a name and start creating the enemy.
 Explanations about each field:
  Enemy Name - Name
  Description - Description of the enemy you want to make (Optional)
  Enemy Sprite - Sprite
  Difficulty - Difficulty of the enemy (range 1-5) (Optional)
  Health - Health points of the enemy
  Speed - Speed of the enemy (range 0-10)
  Detection range - Range wherein the enemy can see you
  Can Cluster - WIP
  Hostility - If the enemy will attack the player on the spot or starts of passive
  Moveset - See explanation: "How to create new moveset"

 Now that the enemy object is created we can go to the next part.

- Creating an enemy instance

 In the prefabs folder in the package there will be a prefab of a blanco enemy
 Drag him into the scene and unpack the prefab, right click > PREFAB > UNPACK COMPLETELY
 After adding him into the scene, you have to add a few things:

 Add a sprite, SPRITE RENDERER > SPRITE > [Select a sprite]
 Add the enemy object, ENEMY BASIC SCRIPT > ENEMY TYPE > [Select the object you just made]
 Add animations, ANIMATOR > CONTROLLER > [Select a enemy controller]
 Make sure the collider is the correct size, BOX COLLIDER 2D > SIZE

 optional: 
 ENEMY BASIC SCRIPT:
  Attack time out - Small time out after using a move, until the enemy can attack again
  Stun time - Small stun after hiting the player who's blocking
  Idle style - WIP
  Patrolling points - WIP
  Roaming range - WIP

After the instance is finished you can drag the instance into a folder to create a prefab.

When this is all correctly put in, the enemy should behave as an enemy should.
Good job (:


Common issues:
 MY ENEMIES WALK THROUGH THE OBSTACLES.
  - Make sure the objects are placed on the Block layer
  You can see this when navigating to your obstacle, 
  and on the top of the inspector you'll see the tab LAYER.
  - Also make sure the correct layer is selected in the enemy prefab
  ENEMY PATHFINDING > OBSTACLE MASK > [Select the correct layer]
 MY ENEMY DOESN'T MOVE.
  - Make sure the speed and detectionRange are correctly assigned in the enemy object
  - Make sure the enemy has a Enemy Basic Script
