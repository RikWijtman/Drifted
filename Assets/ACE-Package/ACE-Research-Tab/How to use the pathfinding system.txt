Good morning and thank you for using ACE

If you opened this file you must be curious how the pathfinding works for the enemies,
and how you can use it in your own game.

The pathfinding system is currenlty working with three scripts:
EnemyPathfinding.cs - This script simply exists of only one function: CanSeePlayer()
 when you run the function it will check if the player is in line of sight
 and if the player is in the detection range.
GridManager.cs - GridManager creates a grid made out of nodes to track the player.
 When the node overlaps over an obstacle, the node won't be walkable and will turn red.
 This grid will be used to track the player when he's out line of sight of the enemy.
 The grid can be adjusted by changing the Grid world size (The size is in unity units)
 And by changing the Node radius (This is the size the nodes will be)
 (The smaller the node radius, the more precise the enemies will move, but runs less smooth)
Pathfinder.cs - This script is connected to the GridManager 
 and uses the nodes to create a path to the player.
 The path created to the player will be visible in the editor when playing. (Has a blue color)

To use the pathfinder you have to have a few things installed 
- A pathfinder/grid instance, this has the GridManager and Pathfinder script on it
 Here you have to set the Grid size and Node radius 
 and set the Unwalkable mask to the layer of the obstacles.
- The EnemyPathfinding script on the enemies
 Here you have to set the player and the obstacle mask (same as previous scripts)
 The other fields don't do anything.

When everything is installed the pathfinding should work.
Good luck (:
